# README

This is a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s Ruby on Rails track. 

The purpose of this project is to implement various authentication systems using the Devise gem.

## Using this repo

I don't recommend you use this repo yourself. This is first and foremost a learning exercise, regardless of how it may be used in the future. If you want to learn authentication, I recommend following along with The Odin Project's curriculum!
